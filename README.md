# How much overhead does react-webcomponentify add?

**TLDR: 2.1kb**

- With react-webcomponentify and components : 9.1kb after gzip
- Without react-webcomponentify and only components: 7kb after gzip
- Overhead caused by react-webcomponentify: 2.1kb after gzip for entire component library

**Hence with react-webcomponentify + preact you can build a web component libarary with bundle size as small as 9kb**

> components include button component and input component
